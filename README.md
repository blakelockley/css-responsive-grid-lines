# Responsive Grid Lines

Small CSS example to create responsive grid lines between columns in dynamically populated Bootstrap rows.

This can be used to create dividers between a variable amount of cloumns populated from a template or to create a table when used in conjuctions with Bootsrap's border utility.

Grid lines are responsive for three sets of media query sizes:
 - Small/Extra Small: 1 column per row
 - Medium: 2 columns per row
 - Large/Extra Large: 3 columns per row
